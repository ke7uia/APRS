# APRS
GPS Module to show time/date/location/speed/send out APRS packets
This uses Arduino UNO. (i would rather use a nano

First added a GPS module to display location, etc.
Next added Display 
Next added selection buttons to display certain items.
Next need to figure out how to:
    turn on ham radio
    press PTT
    send correct data.
Next make a box to have it all fit into.
